**Feature Requested**
Clear and Concise description of the feature.

**Relevant Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your request.

**Checklist**
- [ ] I have checked that there isn't [another hotkey plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.01+Plugins+by+Category/Plugins+that+add+or+manage+hotkeys) that does what I want.
- [ ] In case my issue involves the inclusion/exclusion of punctuation, I have checked that the issue still occurs with the new editor (turning off `Legacy Editor`).
